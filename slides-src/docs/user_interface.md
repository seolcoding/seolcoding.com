Quick Overview
By pressing o or clicking the button in the navigation bar, you can have an overview of your slides so you can jump between them easily.

Presenter Mode
To enter the presenter mode, you can click the button in the navigation panel, or visit http://localhost:<port>/presenter.

When giving a presentation, it's recommended to open two browser windows - one in the play mode for the audience, and another one in the presenter mode for you. Then you can share the first screen to the audience and keep the second screen for yourself.

Whenever you navigate through the slides in the presenter mode, all other opened pages will automatically follow this navigation to stay in sync with the presenter.

Slide Overview
Available since v0.48.0

You can visit an overview of all of your slides by first opening the Quick Overview panel and then clicking the on the top right, or by visiting http://localhost:<port>/overview directly.
